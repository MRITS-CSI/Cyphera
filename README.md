## Introduction


Cyphera was the first round of the event Praestantia conducted by the MRITS CSI student chapter in December 2022. All players were given ciphertext that they needed to decipher using examples given to them.

This repository contains all the code written by our team to make this round possible. Feel free to browse through our code, fork it, and try your own variations on it. The code in general is written to be pretty easy to understand, but you can contact us on Instagram [@csimrits](https://www.instagram.com/csimrits/) if you have any doubts on the specific workings of the code.

We've tried our best to structure our code to be easy to understand, though time complexities forced us somewhat to be a little hasty.

## Repository

The `/public/` folder contains all the files that were statically served to client systems. These include stylesheets, images, and HTML files.

The `/src/` folder contains the actual code implementation. 

`/src/Utils/` contains all the utility scripts written by us to make our lives easier when building this project.

`/src/Components/` contains all the React components we've used and defined.

Happy coding and thank you all for showing interest in our event and our code (and all the blood and tears we've spent in writing it)!
